===============

A lightweight javascript library for creating and manipulating trees.

## Install

```sh
$ npm install forestry --save     #npm
$ bower install forestry --save   #bower
```

## API

### Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPES
An enum like object that gives consumers access to the traversal types that can be passed into the traverse, find, all and reduce functions available on each `Node`.
`Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPES.DFS_PRE` - [Depth First Pre-order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order).  
`Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPES.DFS_POST` - [Depth First Post-order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Post-order).  
`Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPES.BFS` - [Breadth First](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Breadth-first).  
### Forestry.Node
Each node has 'public' parent, data and children properties.  
`node.parent` - the parent node of this node (`undefined` if the node is the root of the tree).  
`node.data` - the data passed into the constructor.  
`node.children` - an array of nodes that are children of this node (empty if the node is a leaf on the tree).
#### Constructor
Create a node with the given data.  
```js
var node = new Forestry.Node(data);
```
#### isRoot()
Returns `true` if the node has no parent and `false` otherwise.
```js
node.isRoot();
```
#### isLeaf()
Returns `true` if the node has no children and `false` otherwise.
```js
node.isLeaf();
```
#### index()
Returns the placement of the node within parent's children.
```js
node.index();
```
#### level()
Returns the level of the node within the tree
```js
node.level();
```
#### addChild(Type: `Node`)
Adds the given node as a child.  
Returns the added node.
```js
node.addChild(new Forestry.Node());
```
#### remove()
Remove's the node from tree and returns it.
```js
node.remove();
```
#### getRoot()
Returns the root node of the tree the node exists in.
```js
node.getRoot();
```
#### climb (Type: `Function`)
Starting from the current node it climbs to the root node passing each node encountered through the given `Function`.
```js
node.climb(function (node) {

});
```
#### traverse (Type: `Function`, [Type `Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPE`|`String`])
Traverses the tree passing each node through the given `Function`.  
Traversal can be halted at any point by returning null from the `Function`.  
An optional second argument can be given to select a traversal type.  
If none is given it defaults to depth first pre-order.  
All traversal types are non-recursive.
```js
node.traverse(function (node) {

});
```
#### find (Type: `Function`, [Type: `Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPE`|`String`])
Finds and returns the first node in the tree that the predicate `Function` returns `true` for.  
Returns `null` if no nodes match the predicate.  
As it utilises the traverse function an optional second argument can be passed to select traversal type.
```js
node.find(function (node) {

});
```
#### all (Type: `Function`, [Type: `Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPE`|`String`])
Finds and returns an array of nodes in the tree that the predicate `Function` returns `true` for.  
Returns an empty array if no nodes match the predicate.  
As it utilises the traverse function an optional second argument can be passed to select traversal type.
```js
node.all(function (node) {

});
```
#### reduce (Type: `Any`, Type: `Function`, [Type: `Forestry.TRAVERSAL_TYPE`|`String`])
Applies a `Function` against an accumulator and each node. Returns the accumulated value.  
As it utilises the traverse function an optional second argument can be passed to select traversal type.
```js
node.reduce(initialValue, function (currentValue, node) {

});
```
#### clone([Type: `Function`])
Returns a clone of the tree.  
While this makes a clone of the actual tree structure it doesn't clone the data initially used in the creation of the `Node` unless the data object has a 'clone' method of it's own or a `Function` is passed in to take care of this (this could be a bespoke function or from another library e.g. lo-dash's clone/cloneDeep fuctions).  
If no data clone function is provided (either as an argument or on each data object) any change to a cloned tree will be local but any change to the `data` property of each node will be echoed across both the cloned and original trees.  
In some cases this may not matter (you may only want to manipulate the tree structure itself).
```js
node.clone();
```

### Forestry.parse(Type: `Object`, [Type: `String`], [Type: `String`])
Parses a given object to a Tree of `Node` objects and returns the root `Node` of the new tree.  
`Array`'s or `Object`'s (key-value maps) of child nodes will be accepted. If an `Object` is found it is coerced to an `Array` and the key for each value `Object` is placed under the property `_key`.  
By default children are expected to reside under a `children` property however an optional second argument can be passed to change this. In the example below we tell it to look for child nodes under the property `links`.  
All properties except `children` (or the second argument if one is passed) will be taken as the basis for the `data` of each node. However, an optional third argument can be passed to cherry pick a single property. In the example below we take only the `name` as the data for each node resulting in `data: 'Joanne'`, by default it would have been an object i.e. `data: {name: 'Joanne'}`.  
```js
var obj = {
      name: 'Joanne',
      links: [{
        name: 'Jake'
      }, {
        name: 'Jason',
        links: [{
          name: 'Jennifer'
        }]
      }]
    },
    rootNode = Forestry.parse(obj, 'links', 'name');
```
